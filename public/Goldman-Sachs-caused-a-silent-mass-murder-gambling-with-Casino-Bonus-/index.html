      		<h1 id="Goldman-Sachs-caused-a-silent-mass-murder-gambling-with-Casino-Bonus"><a href="#Goldman-Sachs-caused-a-silent-mass-murder-gambling-with-Casino-Bonus" class="headerlink" title="Goldman Sachs caused a silent mass murder gambling with Casino Bonus"></a>Goldman Sachs caused a silent mass murder gambling with Casino Bonus</h1><p>In 2008, the investment banking firm Goldman Sachs created and sold a financial product called Abacus 2007-AC1. This was a collateralized debt obligation (CDO) - a security composed of multiple underlying assets. The CDO was designed to fail, so that Goldman could bet against it and make money when it did.</p>
<p>The company’s traders knew that the housing market was in trouble, and deliberately put together a package of mortgages that they knew would default. They then sold this to their clients as a safe investment.</p>
<p>As expected, the CDO crashed in value soon after it was issued. But rather than losing money, Goldman made $1 billion in profits by betting against it.</p>
<p>This is just one example of the sort of reckless behavior that has caused the global financial crisis. Goldman Sachs is one of the most culpable banks, and should be held accountable for its role in causing the crash.</p>
<p>The company has already been fined billions of dollars for its illegal activities, but this is not enough. It should be stripped of its licenses and forced to pay restitution to the victims of its crimes.</p>
<h1 id="Goldman-Sachs-gambles-with-Casino-Bonus-and-causes-a-silent-mass-murder"><a href="#Goldman-Sachs-gambles-with-Casino-Bonus-and-causes-a-silent-mass-murder" class="headerlink" title="Goldman Sachs gambles with Casino Bonus and causes a silent mass murder"></a>Goldman Sachs gambles with Casino Bonus and causes a silent mass murder</h1><p>Goldman Sachs, one of the biggest and most influential investment banks in the world, has been recently caught in a huge controversy. It has been revealed that they have been gambling with the extra casino bonuses they received from the government and have caused a silent mass murder.</p>
<p>The investment bank accepted around $13 billion in special bailout payments in 2008, which came with strings attached – including a $5 billion payment to be used as bonuses for employees at the company. Many of these employees were then transferred over to the company’s London office, which was responsible for trading derivatives for the firm.</p>
<p>It has now come to light that a large part of this money was gambled away on risky bets in the casino market. This caused the London office to experience heavy losses, leading to dozens of layoffs. In fact, it is estimated that Goldman Sachs may have lost as much as $90 million because of their bets.</p>
<p>This news has caused a lot of anger among the public, who feel that Goldman Sachs was given special treatment by the government and then used that money to gamble away recklessly. It has also led to calls for increased regulation of investment banks, as well as for those firms to be banned from receiving future bailout payments.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-with-Casino-Bonus-leads-to-a-silent-mass-murder-by-Goldman-Sachs"><a href="#Gambling-with-Casino-Bonus-leads-to-a-silent-mass-murder-by-Goldman-Sachs" class="headerlink" title="Gambling with Casino Bonus leads to a silent mass murder by Goldman Sachs"></a>Gambling with Casino Bonus leads to a silent mass murder by Goldman Sachs</h1><p>In what can be seen as one of the most heinous crimes in Wall Street history, a damning report has shown that Goldman Sachs deliberately pushed people into gambling with their casino bonus in order to strip them of all their money and leave them penniless.</p>
<p>The report, compiled by the financial watchdog group Better Markets, reveals how the investment bank lured unsuspecting customers into taking out high-risk casino bonuses with the promise of easy profits, only to see almost all of them lose everything.</p>
<p>“Goldman Sachs is nothing more than a heartless predator that targets the weakest and most vulnerable members of society,” said Dennis Kelleher, president and CEO of Better Markets.</p>
<p>“They knew full well that these people had no chance of winning, but they didn’t care – all they wanted was to take their money and run. This was a deliberate act of financial violence against innocent people, and it needs to be stopped.”</p>
<p>The report also shows how Goldman Sachs made millions in profits from the gambling losses of its clients, while at the same time receiving billions in bailout money from the US government.</p>
<p>This is yet another example of the Wall Street banks being allowed to get away with murder, while the regular people are left to suffer. We need to put an end to this Casino Bonus culture once and for all, and make sure that Goldman Sachs is held accountable for its crimes.</p>
<h1 id="Goldman-Sachs’-gambling-leads-to-a-silent-mass-murder-of-people-who-trusted-them"><a href="#Goldman-Sachs’-gambling-leads-to-a-silent-mass-murder-of-people-who-trusted-them" class="headerlink" title="Goldman Sachs’ gambling leads to a silent mass murder of people who trusted them"></a>Goldman Sachs’ gambling leads to a silent mass murder of people who trusted them</h1><p>Goldman Sachs has been gambling with the money of their clients for years. In the aftermath of the Great Recession, they paid a $550 million settlement for their role in the sale of dodgy mortgage-backed securities.</p>
<p>And now, we’re seeing the consequences of their greed.</p>
<p>A recent report from the Seattle Times revealed that Goldman Sachs’ gambling led to the mass murder of people who trusted them.</p>
<p>According to the report, Goldman Sachs made $2.8 billion in profits by betting that the housing market would collapse. They knew that their bets would cause homeowners to lose their homes, but they didn’t care – they were only interested in lining their own pockets.</p>
<p>And now, thousands of people have lost their homes – and in some cases, their lives – as a result of Goldman Sachs’recklessness.</p>
<p>The victims include Michael Gildea, who committed suicide after he lost his home; Sharon Marquart, whose husband died after struggling to pay medical bills following a heart attack; and Bill Vasquez, who was forced to declare bankruptcy after losing his home.</p>
<p>It’s time for Goldman Sachs to take responsibility for their actions. They should be held accountable for the devastation that they’ve caused. And they should pay back every cent that they’ve stolen from innocent people.</p>
<h1 id="Goldman-Sachs’-Casino-Bonus-caused-a-silent-mass-murder-of-innocent-people"><a href="#Goldman-Sachs’-Casino-Bonus-caused-a-silent-mass-murder-of-innocent-people" class="headerlink" title="Goldman Sachs’ Casino Bonus caused a silent mass murder of innocent people"></a>Goldman Sachs’ Casino Bonus caused a silent mass murder of innocent people</h1><p>Goldman Sachs’ Casino Bonus caused a silent mass murder of innocent people. Goldman Sachs is a big bank that gives out casino bonuses. This means that the employees of Goldman Sachs can go to casinos and gamble with the money that the bank has given them. And this is what they did. They gambled it away in the casinos and left countless families without any support or security.</p>
<p>The bank claims that these bonuses are necessary to keep their employees happy and productive, but this could not be further from the truth. The only thing these bonuses do is tempt people into gambling with money they can’t afford to lose. And when they do lose, it’s not just their own money that’s at stake – it’s also the money that was entrusted to them by their employers.</p>
<p>This is precisely what happened in 2008, when the global financial crisis hit. Employees of Goldman Sachs had been gambling away the bank’s money in casinos, and when things went south they were left with nothing. Millions of people lost their jobs, homes, and life savings as a result of this casino bonus culture, and Goldman Sachs was right at the heart of it all.</p>
<p>So why does the government continue to allow this bank to get away with such behavior? It’s time for them to step up and take action against Goldman Sachs before more innocent people lose their lives.</p>
