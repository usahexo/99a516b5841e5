#  How to Win at Blackjack with the LA Clippers

In order to be successful when playing blackjack, it is important to know the basics of the game and how to apply them. The LA Clippers are a professional basketball team based in Los Angeles, California, who can teach you how to win at blackjack.

The aim of blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand by either getting as close to 21 as possible, or by having a higher total value than the dealer. In order to do this, players must first of all understand the different card values:

Aces count as either 1 or 11, whichever is more advantageous for the player.

2s, 3s and 4s count as 2.
5s through 10s count as face value.
Jacks, Queens and Kings count as 10.
An Ace and a Ten, Jack, Queen or King (a so-called "blackjack") counts as 21 and beats any other hand apart from a another blackjack.

To begin with, players must decide how much money they want to wager on each hand. The bets can range from one dollar up to hundreds of dollars per hand. Once the bet is placed, the player is dealt two cards face up. 

     The dealer then deals two cards to themselves - one face up and one face down - and sets one of their cards face down on the table. At this point, players have several options: they can either stand (stick with the two cards that they have), hit (draw another card in an attempt to get closer to 21), or double down (double their bet and receive just one more card). If they go over 21 (), they bust and lose their bet automatically. As soon as both the player and dealer have finished their hands, the showdown takes place: the player's hand is compared against the dealer's hand to see who has won. If the player has a better hand than the dealer (or ties), they win!

 Blackjack is not only a thrilling game to play but it can also be a very lucrative one too - especially if you follow some simple tips from professional sports teams like the LA Clippers!

#  Clippers Eyeing a Repeat of Last Year's Blackjack Win

The LA Clippers are coming off of a historic season in which they won their first ever playoff series. This year, they are looking to go one step further and win the NBA championship.

One of the key contributors to their success last year was their blackjack strategy. This year, they are hoping to use the same strategy to win it all.

The Clippers started using blackjack as a team-building exercise a few years ago. They would gather at a casino and play blackjack together. This helped them develop teamwork and communication skills.

Last year, they took their blackjack game to the next level. They started using a specific strategy that helped them win more games.

Their strategy was based on the fact that blackjack is a game of probability. If you make smart decisions, you will increase your chances of winning.

The Clippers specifically targeted hands that gave them the best chance of winning. They avoided risky hands, and focused on making conservative plays.

This strategy helped them win 54% of their games, which was far better than their opponents. It also helped them win their first playoff series in franchise history.

This year, they are hoping to use the same strategy to win the NBA championship. The odds may be against them, but with this strategy, anything is possible.
