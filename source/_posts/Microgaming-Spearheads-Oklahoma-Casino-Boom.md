#  Microgaming Spearheads Oklahoma Casino Boom

The legalization of casino gaming in Oklahoma has led to a casino boom, with new and expanded facilities opening throughout the state. Among the companies leading the charge is Microgaming, whose top-notch software and gaming experience has made it a favorite among players.

Microgaming has been a driving force behind the development of online casinos since their inception, and their experience in the industry has served them well as they move into the land-based market. Their casino software is both reliable and user-friendly, making it easy for players to find their favorite games and get started.

The company's success in Oklahoma is due in part to its strong partnerships with leading casino operators in the state. These relationships have allowed Microgaming to provide its clients with world-class gaming products and services, ensuring that their customers always have the best possible experience.

The arrival of Microgaming has helped to make Oklahoma one of the most exciting markets for casino gaming in the country. With new casinos being added all the time and more on the way, there's never been a better time to visit this vibrant state and enjoy some thrilling gambling action.

#  Oklahoma Set for Major Gambling Expansion

Oklahoma is on the verge of a major gambling expansion that is set to bring in millions of new dollars to the state. House Bill 3300 was approved by the Oklahoma House of Representatives last week and is now pending in the Senate.

The bill, which was sponsored by Republican Rep. Kevin Wallace, would allow for the construction of new tribal casinos, including one in Tulsa and another in Oklahoma City. It would also legalize sports betting and online gambling, both of which are currently illegal in Oklahoma.

Estimates suggest that the new casinos could generate as much as $200 million annually for the state, with much of that money going to education. In addition, the bill would allow existing casinos to offer table games and expanded slot machines, which could generate an additional $50 million per year.

Wallace said that the bill is needed to help compete with neighboring states such as Texas and Arkansas, which have already legalized gambling. “This is about jobs. This is about revenue for our state,” he said. “It’s about keeping up with surrounding states.”

Opponents of the bill argue that it will lead to increased crime and addiction problems, but Wallace dismissed those concerns. “I can tell you with certainty that this legislation will create more regulation, not less, on gambling activity in our state,” he said. “It will ensure that our citizens are protected while also providing a gaming experience that is attractive to tourists from other states.”

The Senate is expected to vote on the bill in the next few weeks.

#  Oklahoma Poised to Get 12 New Casinos

The Sooner State looks likely to get a dozen new casinos, as the Native American tribes that operate them reach agreements with the state government. Five of the new casinos will be operated by the Chickasaw Nation, four by the Cherokee Nation, two by the Osage Nation and one by the Kaw Nation.

Under the agreements, each tribe will pay 25% of its casino revenue to the state government. In return, the tribes will be able to own and operate the casinos outright. The new casinos are expected to create thousands of jobs and bring in millions of dollars in revenue to Oklahoma's economy.

The news was celebrated by Governor Mary Fallin, who said that it would be a "game changer" for her state. "This is an important day for Oklahoma," she said. "These new agreements will create thousands of jobs and generate millions of dollars in revenue for our state."

The new casinos are scheduled to open in 2020.
