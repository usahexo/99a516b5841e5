#  Tennessee Titans – Iso Craze in Sports Betting

The Tennessee Titans have become one of the most popular teams in the NFL to bet on this season and for good reason. Led by quarterback Marcus Mariota and rookie head coach Mike Vrabel, the Titans have been one of the most explosive teams in the league, averaging over 27 points per game.

Their high-powered offense has allowed them to run up some big point spreads, which is great news for sports bettors. In their last three games, the Titans have covered spreads of -8.5, -10 and -13.5 points.

Tennessee’s odds of winning the Super Bowl have also shortened dramatically in recent weeks. At one point, they were listed as 100/1 long shots but now they are down to just 20/1 at some sportsbooks.

If you’re looking to bet on a team that is likely to win and cover the spread each week, look no further than the Tennessee Titans.

Tennessee Titans football is one of the most exciting sports to bet on, and with the NFL season just around the corner, it's time to start looking at which teams offer the best value for your money.
