#  Chiefs looking to bounce back in 2017 with new handicapping strategy 

The Kansas City Chiefs had a rough 2016 season, finishing with a 2-14 record. This offseason, the team is looking to rebound with a new handicapping strategy.

According to head coach Andy Reid, the Chiefs will be using a spread offense this year. "We're going to spread the ball around and give our players a chance to make plays," Reid said. "We think this will be more effective against opposing defenses."

Quarterback Alex Smith is on board with the new strategy. "I'm excited about this new offense," he said. "I think it will give us a chance to win more games."

The Chiefs open the season on September 11th against the San Diego Chargers.

#  How to bet on the Chiefs this season and win every time 

The Kansas City Chiefs are coming into this season as one of the top favorites to win the Super Bowl. If you’re looking to make some money by betting on the Chiefs, here’s what you need to know.

The first thing you need to do is find a reputable sportsbook that will allow you to bet on the Chiefs. Once you’ve found a good sportsbook, you need to figure out how much you want to bet.

Most sportsbooks will allow you to bet on the Chiefs at odds of +650, which means that if you bet $100, you could win $650. However, some sportsbooks may offer higher or lower odds, so it’s important to shop around and find the best deal.

If you’re confident in the Chiefs, then betting on them to win the Super Bowl may be a smart decision. The odds of winning the Super Bowl are currently +450, so if you put down $100 on the Chiefs, you could win $450 if they win the Super Bowl.

However, there are many other bets that can be made on the Chiefs this season. You can bet on them to win their division at odds of +175, or you could bet on them to make it to the AFC Championship at odds of +800.

No matter what type of bet you decide to make, always make sure that you research the team and understand the risk involved before making your final decision. If you do your homework and make smart bets, then winning money betting on the Chiefs this season should be easy.

#  Chiefs hope to use handicapping to even the playing field this year 

Kansas City Chiefs general manager Brett Veach pulled the trigger on a trade for Oakland Raiders receiver Amari Cooper early in the season, and the move signaled that the Chiefs were all-in for 2018. The idea was to give second-year quarterback Patrick Mahomes some added firepower to help him out as he begins his first full season as the starter.

The early returns haven't been great, as the Chiefs sit at 2-3 after four weeks of play. Cooper has only caught 11 passes for 146 yards and a touchdown through those three games, and it's become clear that he's not really a fit in head coach Andy Reid's offense.

This could create an opportunity for Veach to swing another deal before Tuesday's deadline. Heading into Week 5, the Chiefs are only a game out of first place in the AFC West, but they're going to need to start winning if they want to make any noise in the postseason.

One possibility that's been mentioned is acquiring Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman. The 30-year-old is in the final year of his contract, and he would provide an immediate boost to Kansas City's secondary. Sherman is a four-time Pro Bowler and has been one of the best cornerbacks in the NFL over the past several seasons.

There are obviously some hurdles that would need to be cleared before any deal could be finalized, but it looks like Veach is open to making another move before Tuesday's deadline. The Chiefs have already proved this season that they can't just rely on Mahomes to carry them; they'll need everyone on board if they want to make a playoff run.

#  NFL gambling: Handicapping the Kansas City Chiefs' chances in 2017 

The Kansas City Chiefs enjoyed a breakout season in 2016, thanks in part to the stellar play of young quarterback Patrick Mahomes. Now that the bar has been set high, what can we expect from the Chiefs in 2017?

First and foremost, it's important to remember that the Chiefs only went 10-6 last season. They were a good team, but they were not great. In order to be a Super Bowl contender, they'll need to improve on both sides of the ball.

Offensively, Mahomes will need to take another step forward in order to make up for the offseason losses of Jamaal Charles and Jeremy Maclin. Tyreek Hill and Travis Kelce should continue to be big contributors, but there are questions about who will step up as the No. 2 receiver.

The Chiefs' defense was middle of the pack last year, but they could take a big step forward this season with some key additions, including linebacker Anthony Hitchens and defensive lineman Bennie Logan. If they can simply be average on defense, that should be enough to get them back into the playoffs.

All things considered, the Chiefs look like a good bet to return to the playoffs in 2017. They're not quite ready to compete for a Super Bowl title, but there's plenty of potential for them to take another step forward this season.

#  Expert tips for betting on the Chiefs this season

Kansas City Chiefs fans have good reason to be excited for the upcoming NFL season. Andy Reid is one of the most experienced and successful coaches in the league, and the team’s offense is loaded with talented players such as quarterback Patrick Mahomes, tight end Travis Kelce, and wide receiver Tyreek Hill.

But what about the defense?

Many experts are predicting that the Chiefs will have a successful season but will ultimately fall short due to their lack of defensive firepower. So is it worth betting on the Chiefs this season?

In this article, we will discuss some expert tips for betting on the Chiefs this season. We will also look at some of the key matchups that could determine their fate in the playoffs.

First and foremost, it is important to remember that Andy Reid is a very good coach. He has a proven track record of success, and he knows how to win in the playoffs. The Chiefs also have a very talented offense, which should be able to keep them in games against any opponent.

That said, the defense is still a weak spot for this team. They ranked near the bottom of the league in terms of both yards allowed and points allowed last season, and they don’t seem likely to improve much this year. As a result, it is important to avoid betting on the Chiefs in games where they are favored by more than 10 points.

There are several key matchups that could determine the Chiefs’ playoff fate this year. The first one comes in Week 1 against the Los Angeles Chargers. This is a tough matchup for Kansas City, as the Chargers have one of the best offenses in the league. However, if they can pull off an upset victory here it would set the tone for the rest of the season and give them plenty of confidence heading into later games.

The second matchup comes in Week 5 against Tom Brady and the New England Patriots. This is another difficult game for Kansas City, but if they can manage to pull off an upset victory it would be a huge statement win and would give them an excellent chance of making it to Super Bowl LIII.

Finally, we come to Week 11 when they take on Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs. This game could go either way, but it should be entertaining nonetheless.
