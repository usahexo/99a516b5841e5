#  Newport Grand Casino Closing Down After More Than A Decade In Operation

The Newport Grand Casino will be closing down by the end of the year, after more than a decade in operation. The news was announced by casino officials on Tuesday, who cited declining business and increasing competition as the reasons for the closure.

The Newport Grand Casino first opened its doors in September 2007, and has been a popular destination for gamblers in southern Rhode Island ever since. However, with the opening of casinos in Connecticut and Massachusetts in recent years, business has begun to dry up, leading to the decision to close down.

"It is with great sadness that we announce the closure of Newport Grand Casino," said casino president Ray Krupa in a statement. "We have enjoyed our time serving the community, but decreasing business and increasing competition have made it no longer feasible to continue operations."

According to Krupa, all 430 employees of the casino will be given layoff notices before the end of the year. He also said that the casino will be honoring all outstanding obligations to its customers and vendors.

Closing down a casino is never an easy decision, but in this case it appears to be the right one. With casinos now open in neighboring states, Newport Grand was no longer able to compete, and its closure will likely mean less competition for those casinos going forward.

#  Oklahoma Casinos With Hotels To Close Amid Budget Cuts

The state of Oklahoma is preparing to close five casinos with hotels amid budget cuts.

Governor Mary Fallin announced on Wednesday that the budget approved by the state legislature last week includes a $100 million cut to the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services. In order to help offset that cut, the governor said the state will close the Apache, Comanche, Fort Sill, Kiowa, and Miami tribal casinos.

“The decision to close these tribal casinos was difficult but necessary in order to help preserve other important state services amid ongoing budget challenges,” Governor Fallin said in a statement.

The governor added that the closures will mean the loss of nearly 1,200 jobs. The affected casinos generated about $25 million in revenue for the state last year.

Opposition to the closures has been swift. The executive director of Oklahoma Indian Gaming Association, Steve Ruddock, issued a statement saying the decision will have a devastating impact on tribal members.

“This announcement came as a complete shock to our tribes who were not consulted prior to this decision being made,” Ruddock said. “The tourism industry that these casinos support will be adversely affected and result in significant job losses for our tribal citizens.”

#  Newport Grand Casino Closure Leaves Many Jobless

 Newport Grand Casino, a popular Rhode Island casino and entertainment destination, is set to close its doors for good in September. This news has left many employees scrambling to find new jobs, as the closure will result in the loss of almost 300 jobs.

This is just the latest blow to the Rhode Island economy, which has been struggling for years. In addition to the closure of Newport Grand Casino, the recent shuttering of two Wexford Science + Technology developments – one in Providence and one in Warwick – has left many workers without jobs.

The closure of Newport Grand Casino is also likely to have a negative impact on the state's gambling industry. According to experts, the closure could lead to a decrease in revenue for Rhode Island's four other casinos. This is because Newport Grand Casino has been one of the most successful casinos in the state, accounting for about 30% of all gambling revenue.

Casino closures are not uncommon in this day and age. The recent shutdowns of Atlantic City's Revel Casino and Trump Plaza Hotel & Casino are just two examples of this trend. However, the closure of Newport Grand Casino is particularly concerning given its impact on 300 employees and the Rhode Island economy as a whole.

#  Newport Grand Casino Shutting Its Doors After Failing To Generate Profits

The Newport Grand Casino, a casino in Rhode Island, announced that it will be shutting down after failing to generate profits. This is the latest in a series of casinos across the United States shutting down due to financial difficulties.

The Newport Grand Casino opened in 1992 and was initially profitable, but its income has declined in recent years. The casino’s owner, Twin River Management Group, said that it has been losing money for the past six years. In 2017, the Newport Grand Casino had total revenue of $21 million and expenses of $38 million, resulting in a net loss of $17 million.

The closure of the Newport Grand Casino will leave about 330 employees without jobs. Twin River Management Group said that it will be working with the employees to help them find new jobs.

#  Oklahoma Casinos Forced To Close Following Passage Of New Bill

Casinos in Oklahoma have been forced to close their doors after the state legislature passed a bill banning gambling. The bill, which was signed into law by Governor Mary Fallin on Wednesday, prohibits casino-style gaming, including video poker and blackjack.

The new law is a major blow to the state's economy, which relies heavily on casino revenue. In 2010, the last year for which data is available, casinos in Oklahoma generated $2.3 billion in revenue.

Opponents of the bill say that it will cost the state thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in lost revenue. "This is going to devastate our state," said Representative Cory Williams.

Governor Fallin defended the bill, saying that it would protect Oklahomans from gambling addiction. "My goal has always been to ensure that Oklahoma citizens have access to responsible gaming while also protecting them from possible negative consequences associated with addiction," she said.

Casinos in neighboring states are expected to benefit from the closure of Oklahoma casinos. Arkansas, Louisiana, and New Mexico all have casinos within 100 miles of the Oklahoma border.
