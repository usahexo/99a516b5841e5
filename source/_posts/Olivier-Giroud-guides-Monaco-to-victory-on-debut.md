#  Olivier Giroud guides Monaco to victory on debut

Olivier Giroud marked his Monaco debut in style on Saturday evening, scoring the winner in a 1-0 victory over Nantes.

The France international joined the Ligue 1 champions from Chelsea in a €18 million deal last month and was handed a starting berth by Leonardo Jardim against his former club.

Giroud repaid his manager's faith with an accomplished display, capped by a 46th-minute strike that settled an entertaining contest at the Stade de la Beaujoire.

Monaco had to weather some early pressure from Nantes, but they took the lead shortly before the interval when Giroud controlled Rony Lopes' pass before firing into the bottom-left corner.

Nantes pushed for an equaliser after the break, but they were unable to find a way past Monaco goalkeeper Danijel Subasic as the principality club claimed their first win of 2019.

#  Falcao fires Monaco to second successive win

Radamel Falcao scores his first hat-trick of the season as Monaco go second in Ligue 1 with a 4-0 victory over Bordeaux.

The on-loan Manchester United striker struck twice in the first half and once after the break to take his tally to four goals in two games since returning from a calf injury.

Kamil Glik and Kylian Mbappe also got on the scoresheet as Leonardo Jardim's side recorded their sixth successive league win at home.

Monaco are now two points behind leaders Nice, who they play next weekend, and four ahead of fourth-placed Paris Saint-Germain.

#  Radamel Falcao strikes as Monaco beat Toulouse

 Radamel Falcao struck deep into stoppage time as Monaco beat Toulouse 1-0 to extend their unbeaten start to the Ligue 1 season to six games on Sunday.

The Colombia striker, who has been linked with a move away from the club in January, latched onto a through ball from Benjamin Mendy and fired into the bottom corner to give Monaco all three points.

It was a harsh blow for Toulouse, who had dominated the second half and created the better chances, but Monaco were clinical in front of goal and move up to third in the table.

#  Monaco make it two wins from two with a hard-fought victory over Angers 

After a resounding 4-0 victory over Strasbourg in their opening game of the season, Monaco were looking to make it two wins from two as they took on Angers. 

It was a tight affair for the most part, with neither side managing to create too many clear-cut chances. However, it was Monaco who finally broke the deadlock in the 73rd minute when Keita Balde found the back of the net with a composed finish. 

The result was then put beyond doubt in stoppage time when Radamel Falcao scored his first goal of the season, and it was a well-deserved win for Leonardo Jardim's men. 

There were positives for Angers to take away from the game also, with striker Karl Toko Ekambi impressing once again. However, they will need to start picking up points soon if they want to avoid relegation this season. 

Here are three things we learned from Monaco's win over Angers: 

1) Monaco are looking good early on in the season

It was always going to be tough for Monaco following their mass exodus of stars during the summer transfer window, but so far they have looked pretty good. They dominated against Strasbourg last week and managed to get another victory here against Angers - even without Neymar, Mbappe and co. 

2) Keita Balde is off to a flying start at Monaco

The former Lazio man has been one of Monaco's standout players so far this season. He scored the opener against Angers and also impressed with his all-round play. If he can keep up this level of performances, he could be one of the signings of the season. 

3) Karl Toko Ekambi is a player worth watching out for

Angers' ace striker was once again in fine form against Monaco, bagging himself another goal. He looks like he could be one of the key players for them this season and could cause some problems for opposition defences.

#  Monaco maintain perfect start to Ligue 1 season with 5th consecutive win

# Late goals from Mbappé and Lemar secure victory over Strasbourg

# Monaco sit top of the table with a perfect 15 points from 15

AS Monaco recorded their fifth consecutive win in all competitions with a 2-0 victory over Strasbourg on Saturday night.

A goal in either half from Kylian Mbappé and Thomas Lemar was enough to seal all three points for the home side, who now sit top of the Ligue 1 table with a perfect 15 points from 15 games.

The result also maintained Monaco’s 100% start to the season and they have now not tasted defeat in any competition since their loss to PSG in the French Super Cup final back in August.

It was another typically impressive performance from Leonardo Jardim’s side, who continue to look like one of the strongest teams in Europe despite losing a number of key players over the summer.

Strasbourg had their chances throughout the game but were ultimately undone by two late goals from Mbappé and Lemar, both of which were finished superbly.
