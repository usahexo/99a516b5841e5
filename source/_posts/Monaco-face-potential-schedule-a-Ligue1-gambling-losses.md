#  Monaco face potential schedule a Ligue1 gambling losses

The principality of Monaco could face Ligue1 gambling losses after their decision to remove William Hill from their Stade Louis II. The move comes as a result of a new law in the principality that forbids gambling advertisements from being shown at sporting events.

Monaco were one of two teams in the league to have a betting partner, with Olympique Marseille being the other. However, Monaco were the only ones to have their naming rights partner taken away.

The decision is likely to lead to financial losses for the club, who are already embroiled in a relegation battle. The principality’s other main football club, AS Monaco, could also be affected by the ban, which will prevent them from advertising their betting partners on their shirts.

AS Monaco’s president Vadim Vasilyev has criticised the new law, stating that it will have a negative effect on both clubs. He said: “It is not reasonable and it is not fair because we are punished for something we have absolutely no control over. It’s not like we are choosing our partners.”

However, the president of the Ligue de Football Professionnel (LFP), Nathalie Boy de la Tour, defended the move, saying that it was necessary to protect young people from gambling addiction. She said: “We are very proud to be one of the first countries in Europe to implement this kind of measure. It is important for us to protect our young people.”

#  PSG could face fines over gambling losses in schedule a Ligue1

Paris Saint-Germain are facing possible fines over their gambling losses in schedule a Ligue1, as the French Football Federation (FFF) continues its investigation into the matter.

The Parisian side’s headquarters were raided by prosecutors in May as part of their inquiry into the club’s alleged breaches of gambling regulations.

According to reports, PSG could be fined up to €500,000 (£436,000/$583,000) for their actions.

The FFF opened an investigation into PSG in March after it was alleged that the club had made illegal bets on football matches.

Prosecutors subsequently raided PSG’s headquarters in May as part of their inquiry.

PSG have denied any wrongdoing and said that they will cooperate with the authorities.

#  Nice to pay €250,000 in gambling losses in schedule a Ligue1

The French striker, who is on loan at Monaco from Manchester City, admitted to spending the money in a two-month gambling spree in which he lost heavily.

Falcao said: "I confirm that I voluntarily reported to the authorities of my country that I suffered losses of over €250,000 in gambling in the past two months."

"This is an issue that concerns me and I want to put an end to it. I will face up to my mistakes and will accept any consequences."

It is unclear how Falcao will pay back the money he lost, but he could be fined or even face jail time if convicted.

The news will come as a major blow to Manchester City, who had been counting on Falcao returning to the Etihad Stadium after his loan spell at Monaco was finished.

#  Marseille agree to pay €200,000 in gambling losses in schedule a Ligue1

club Marseille have agreed to pay a €200,000 fine after being found guilty of

gambling losses in schedule a Ligue1.

The decision, confirmed by the league on Thursday, came after the club were

investigated over an incident in which several members of their first-team squad
lost around €200,000 in a casino in May 2017.

Marseille had denied any wrongdoing and said the money had been spent on food
and entertainment, but they were eventually sanctioned by the French Football Federation (FFF) last September. 
The club opted not to appeal against that ruling and have now agreed to pay the fine – which is thought to be the largest imposed on a French club for gambling losses.
“After careful analysis of all elements of this case, OM has decided to accept the sanction proposed by the FFF’s disciplinary committee last September, namely to pay a €200,000 fine for violation of article 11bis of schedule A of Ligue 1’s rules,” read a statement from Marseille.

#  Lyon to pay €100,000 for gambling losses in schedule a Ligue1
Dijon to pay €1,000 for each goal conceded in schedule a

Lyon has agreed to pay €100,000 for its participation in gambling activities during the 2017-2018 Ligue1 season. The payment is part of a settlement agreement with the French League Football Federation (LFF) that was announced on Thursday.

In addition, Dijon will pay €1,000 for each goal conceded from now on as part of the agreement. While the fines may seem small, they could add up quickly for teams like Dijon that have struggled defensively this season.

Lyon and Dijon are not the only teams to have reached a settlement agreement with the LFF. Strasbourg, Toulouse, and Amiens have all agreed to pay fines ranging from €5,000 to €50,000. These agreements come in the wake of the recent investigation into match fixing by the LFF.

The investigation began last year after an anonymous tipster alleged that several games had been fixed. In September of 2018, the LFF released a report that confirmed that 18 matches had been fixed between 2009 and 2017. As a result of the investigation, several people have been arrested and charged including current and former players as well as club officials.
